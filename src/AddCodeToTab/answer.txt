Certainly! Here's a TypeScript function named `AddCodeToTab` that performs the described actions:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

async function AddCodeToTab(code: string) {
    const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
    if (!editor) {
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('No active editor');
        return;
    }

    const selection = editor.selection;

    await editor.edit(editBuilder => {
        if (selection.isEmpty) {
            const position = selection.active;
            editBuilder.insert(position, code);
        } else {
            editBuilder.replace(selection, code);
        }
    });
}
```

To use this function, make sure you have the necessary setup for developing VS Code extensions. You can call this function as part of a command in your `activate` function or however needed within your extension.
